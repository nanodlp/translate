<b>What is/are the reason(s) to use it?</b><br>
<p>
    Jagged edges occur due to undersampling. The cause of undersampling is because of having low resolution of the printer or loss of information in the picture. Enabling Anti-aliasing will solve this problem and smoothen transition between different layers.
