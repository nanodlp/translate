Pixel Dimming ensure the highest print quality along with an easy setup experience. This feature would have
following effects by dimming the pixels:
<ul>
	<li>Prevents over-cure</li>
	<li>Preserves details</li>
	<li>Makes it possible to use one profile/cure time for different pieces with different thicknesses</li>
	<li>Increases the PDMS life time</li>
</ul><br>

<b>What is/are the reason(s) to use it?</b><br>
<p>
	Pixel Dimming somehow is a necessity on large, solid parts. The larger the area being cured for any
	particular layer, the more of a runaway cure you will experience. That is why, the layer over cures
	despite all attempts to prevent it through adjusting cure times. But by enabling Pixel Dimming, you can
	fix it quite easily.
