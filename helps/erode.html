<b>Why use Erode and Dilate?</b>
<br>
<p>Sometimes when printing without a raft, you may notice about the elephantâ€™s foot, which means the first
    layer is slightly larger than the rest due to higher cure time.
    <br>
    <br>
    While printing objects for practical applications, it can pose a large problem due to physical
    properties of resin such as shrinkage after it becomes solid. By using Erode and Dilate, you can resolve
    the issue.
    <br>
    <br>
    Keep in mind the positive value represents the Dilate Areas and Erode Areas is defined by negative
    value.
