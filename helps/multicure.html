Print the same object with multiple cure times all at once. The chosen profile's settings will be applied on all copies except normal layer cure times.
<br>
<br>
In addition to all specified cure times, an extra object will be printed using profile cure time. It only will replace normal layer cure time and would not affect burnin layers.
<br>
<br>
For example if there is 3 cure times specified: 3,4,5 and chosen profile cure time is 2.5. Four copies of the object will be printed with following cure times 2.5,3,4,5 
<br>
<br>
If there is not enough space to print all cure times, lowest ones will be chosen.

On profile level it is possible to modify gap around objects.
