Wrong HDMI settings could cause missing lines and also your display could have dead pixel.<br><br>
There are two buttons one for horizontal lines and another one for vertical lines.<br>
Each time you press one of them pixels move 1px, atleast ten clicks needed to check all pixels in each direction.
