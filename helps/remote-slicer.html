<b>What is Remote Slicing?</b>
<br>
Remote slicing is the capability of handing over the process of slicing to a remote desktop computer
or
server. It is mostly developed for boards with low specification, like Raspberry Pi.<br><br>
<b>What is/are the reason(s) to use it?</b><br>
<p>
	On boards like Raspberry Pi, the process of slicing large STL files could take up to 30 minutes,
	whether
	on a normal Personal Computer, it takes about 2 to 3 minutes. By using Remote Slicing your waiting
	time
	decreases significantly.
</p><br>
<b>How to use it?</b>
<p>There are two ways to use Remote Slicing</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>First Approach</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have installed Nanodlp on your local Personal Computer, try to connect to Nanodlp
			on
			Raspberry Pi by opening your favorite browser. Once you upload a plate on Nanodlp
			Raspberry Pi,
			the Nanodlp on your Personal Computer will be detected and the process of slicing is going
			to
			start.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Second Approach</b></li>
	<ol>
		<li>Navigate through <code><b>Setup</b></code> > <code><b>Machine Settings</b></code></li>
		<li>On the first row, choose <code><b>Advanced</b></code> by selecting <code><b>Setup
					Mode</b></code>
		</li>
		<li>By looking at the last section, <code><b>Various Settings</b></code>, you can find
			<code><b>Remote
					Slicer</b></code> on the first row, where you can enter the IP alongside the Port
			number.
		</li>
	</ol>
</ul>

<h4>How remote Slicer works: (example)</h4>
<ol>
	<li>NanoDLP installed on Raspberry Pi and Windows computer being used by user.</li>
	<li>A new plate uploaded to Raspberry Pi.</li>
	<li>Raspberry Pi NanoDLP detects active NanoDLP installation on users's Windows computer.</li>
	<li>Raspberry Pi transfer required data to Windows.</li>
	<li>NanoDLP on Windows start processing.</li>
	<li>NanoDLP on Raspberry Pi get status update from Windows version. And wait until slicing get
		completed.</li>
	<li>NanoDLP on Raspberry Pi fetch prepared data.</li>
</ol>
